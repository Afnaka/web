    <h1>Onam</h1>
    <img src="./images/onam1.jpg">
    <p>Onam is a core part of Keralian traditions and folklore. The legend of Onam begins with the reign of King Mahabali, a benevolent ruler. The gods were not satiated by his benevolence and requested Lord Vishnu to intervene. 

        Lord Vishnu approached King Mahabali in his Vamana Avatar and asked Mahabali to grant him land equal to three of his steps. He then grew in size and covered the entire universe in 2 steps. Realising Lord Vishnuâ€™s identity, Mahabali offered up his head for the final step.
        
        Pleased with his devotion, Lord Vishnu sent Mahabali to Pathala (netherworld), where he was allowed to live in peace. He was also granted permission to visit Kerala once a year to see his devoted subjects</p>
